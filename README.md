# The Assignment: My Portfolio with React 

* Updated portfolio featuring 6 total projects

* Use React

* A `Header` component that appears on multiple pages

* A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times on a single page 

* Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router

* A `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages

* Update GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring those same projects

This Assignment was another update to the portfolio with React it was the most fun I have had on any assignment because it was utilizing React which comparing HTML, Handlebars, and React I would choose React every time. As stated above it needed a Header and Footer on multiple pages which was easily built with the utilization of components. Since the original portfolio had multiple pages it was easy to split it all up into the pages and route those for each page. It tied in routing, CSS, JS, and server based applications. To complete the requirements above seemed very daunting at first but when I sat down to do it it all came together. It was the best feeling to run npm start and see Compiled Successfully in green lettering telling me it all worked. 

# Lessons: 

In this Assignment I took that whole React experience and ran with it I wanted to truly understand the depths of react since I have seen so many jobs hiring for it. With this in your arsenal you can go to any company and qualify for a great and prosperous job. This technology is newer to the Web Development world and it will only be more sought after as the field grows. I have taken this into account and learned a valuable lesson for react that I will most likely pursue as a first job choice in my new career.
